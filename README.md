### Deep learning model to transform courses into rap lyrics

## Presentation
This project is dedicated to transform courses into rap lyrics for the company [Onzic](https://www.onzic.com/). The company is a streaming platform that turns the educative program into rap music to help school children to revise their exams.
I worked with one of the co-founder, Abou Tour√©, on a NLP Model using Attention layers.

The dataset comes from the previous lyrics made by Onzic from different subjects of the French school program: History, Geography, Biology, Economy, Philosophy.

The model has pretty good results to create rhymes and verses. 
To improve the model, we could consider increasing the among of datas as well as including a new variable based on the phonetics.
